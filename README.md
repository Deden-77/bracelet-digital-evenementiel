# The SEB Project
SEB (Cute name for "Smart Event Bracelets") is a project that aims to create Smart Bracelets for the BDE Eiffel, for them to use in party.

## Features and highlights
- Replace entrance tickets and textile bracelets
- Stock guests's "tickets boissions" (a kind of money used during partys to buy drinks and food)
- Stock guests's "tickets vestiaires" (the location of their things when they give their personals stuff to the staff, so that they can get back their things with a tap of a wrist)
- Prove majority to buy alcohool (so that minors can be accepted in parties without being able to buy alcohool)
- Prove membership of the BDE to get reductions on some drinks, without staff having to ask
- Give free TB to the staffs

### Additional features
- Alchool counter / Limiter: The band could count how much alcool have been paid by a user to aproximate their alchool level.
- Photobooth: Members could recieve their photos via email or SMS once tapping their band to the photo device.
- Add TB fidelity

## Constraints
- Security: Wristbands should be unfalsifiable, uncopyable to prevent duplicates. users shoulden't be able to remove the wristbands during the party, unless they cut it.
- Acessibility: Everyone should be able to use the system
- Speed: Usage of the system should be fast and easy, not to slow down operations (for example at the bar, or at the entrance)

## Solutions
TODO : Explain here the solutions found to the contraints
